"""K4 converter — sealed work list → one kanban_create payload.

Input: evidence/planning/worklist.json + an ADMITTED admission-receipt.json
whose seals match disk (+ verification/loop/steps.json for the parent and
the attempt). Output: exactly one payload — the head cluster as an M3 card
with a typed K1 body, or M4 VERIFY when the list is empty and nothing is
deferred — under a receipt-bound idempotency key. Zero payloads unless
admitted. K4 re-derives the activation/pilot verdict and the tool pins
from pins.json itself; the receipt text never overrides them.

Does not mint. Does not import create_task. Writes the body to
evidence/bodies/m3-<cluster>.json (m4-M4_VERIFY.json).
