"""Package the destination, then start it against the decided database.

The compile/test tuple is a repair measure, not a readiness claim: a tree can
compile and pass its tests and still be unbuildable (pilot v7 reached [0,0,0]
and then failed the coverage plugin on Java 21 class files and Quarkus
augmentation on an unconfigured datasource). So the transition out of the
repair loop is measured here, in two gates:

  package  the FULL configured Maven lifecycle (`mvn verify`), coverage and
           integration checks retained, no goal skipped. Writes
           verification/build/package.json with the artifact and its digest.
  boot     that same artifact started with the decided datasource, given a
           bounded time to become ready, probed over HTTP. Writes
           verification/build/boot.json.

Neither gate is ever initialised to a pass: a gate that did not run is absent
from its receipt as ``ran: false``, and the work list treats that as unknown.
A failure that the destination cannot repair by editing its own tree (no
credentials, database unreachable) is recorded as a ``blocker``, not as a
repair obligation.

Exit 0 when every gate it was asked to run passed, 1 when one failed or was
blocked, 2 usage."""
