"""Refuse a destination whose effective datasource is not the decided one (M2).

The decision lives in decisions.yaml (`datasource`, under an accepted ADR) and
is rendered by bootstrap-destination. This checker measures the rendered tree
against the decision, at M2, before any worker reaches runtime verification:

  * the values the platform would resolve FOR THE SELECTED PROFILE must equal
    the decision. A %profile-prefixed key overrides the unprefixed one when
    that profile is active, so both are read and the override wins; and a
    key for a DIFFERENT profile that would point at another database is
    reported, because nothing stops that profile being selected at run time.
    An unprefixed key must still be present: the platform resolves the
    datasource at build time, and pilot v7 reached an empty work list with
    only %hsqldb.* keys and then failed augmentation with "Datasource
    <default> is not configured";
  * the JDBC extension documented for the decided db_kind must be in the pom,
    and no OTHER db-kind extension may be there. Not because the platform
    could not choose -- db-kind is set, so it can -- but because a driver the
    decision never selected has no reason to be in the build, and the
    bootstrap is what must not leave it behind;
  * credentials must be environment references, never literals in the tree;
  * the isolated instance must be THIS RUN's. Every run gets its own parity
    database, created by trusted platform code when the workspace is
    initiated, and stamp-run-resources.py writes its name here from
    migration.yaml. An UNSTAMPED instance means that never happened, and a run
    that plans against nobody's database would capture its oracles against
    whatever the namespace happens to hold. A stamped name is not enough
    either: the endpoint the workspace holds is parsed and compared with the
    assignment and the platform receipt (planner.run_identity), here as well as
    at every operation that connects;
  * when the decision says the source assets own schema and seed, those files
    must exist in the destination.

It does not prove the configuration works. Packaging and boot verification do
that, and neither replaces the other.

Exit 0 PASS, 1 REFUSE, 2 usage."""
