# M1 ANALYZE paved-road (index)

This skill is the **M1 procedure index**. Ordered mandated steps live in
`steps.json`. `audit.json` is generated from that file — do not edit it
by hand. Do not copy subskill SKILL.md bodies into this file.

Pin **only** this leaf (`--skill paved-road-m1`). Subskills load via
`skill_view` from the step list. Producer of artifact `m1-analyze` is
`assemble-evidence-bundle` (`evidence/planning/evidence-bundle.json`),
the root of the planner digest chain (SAD §6).

## When to Use

- This card is **M1 ANALYZE**.
- **Not** M2 PLAN (`paved-road-m2`).
- **Not** dest-init mint (`dispatch-phase`).

## Procedure

1. Read `steps.json`. Follow that listed order:
   freeze → build → JDK-model inventory → bytecode (optional) → context probe
   → MTA → assemble → derive the scenario corpus → capture the source →
   qualify the captures → the same three again for the source's **enabled**
   security setting → attach.
   - `skill` — `skill_view` that leaf and follow its SKILL.md.
   - `native` — run the named script under `.hermes/kernel/`
     (`kanban_attach.py --task "$HERMES_KANBAN_TASK" --exec`).
2. KEEP paths on the step must exist under the workspace root.
3. A producer that records `status: unpinned` (structure extractor) or a build that
   records `outcome: failure` is **evidence**, not a defect to repair.
   A qualification verdict of `FAIL` or `INCONCLUSIVE` is the same kind of
   thing: a recorded fact about the **source**, which becomes a coverage gap
   at M4 and never a destination card. The step is red only when the gate
   could not judge at all (no corpus, no capture, a provenance that does not
   bind).
   extractor unpinned / JDK mismatch → `kanban_block` (kind `needs_input`, the pin is an
   ADR). Build failure → continue; the ledger makes it planning-only.
   The three `-enabled` steps are the same kind of thing: with no
   `security:` section in `decisions.yaml`, or with a declared credential
   this workspace does not hold, each writes its receipt with `status:
   idle` and the reason and exits 0. That is a **recorded blocker**
   (ADR-014), not a red step and not silence. The reason names the missing
   environment **variable**, never a credential.
4. `bash .hermes/skills/harness/dispatch-phase/scripts/autostart-migration.sh --root /projects/modernized`
   — binds the platform-recorded pilot authorization (dest-init wrote who
   authorized this run from the DevWorkspace its creator started) to the
   bundle you just produced, and mints M2. It decides nothing: an unbound
   seal with no named authorizer, one already bound, one not recorded by the
   platform, or an unfit bundle are all refused, and admission still gates
   the plan. Mints nothing under a not-activated planner; idempotent.
5. Happy-path terminator: `kanban_request_review` (reviewer `reviewer`), then end the turn. A later nudge to finish is already satisfied by the review handoff; do not answer it with `kanban_complete` (K2 refuses it for the implementer) or `kanban_block`.
6. `kanban_block` for external/platform (MaaS 500, missing key, GPU).
7. Reviewer runs `python3 .hermes/skills/paved-road/paved-road-m1/scripts/assert-paved-road-audit.py --root /projects/modernized "$HERMES_KANBAN_TASK"`.
   The official log is `$HERMES_HOME/kanban/logs/<id>.log`. Do not pass `--log` unless that file exists; a workshop path such as `/projects/modernized/kanban/logs/` is not the official log (v9 M1 `t_e84503a8`).

## Gotchas

- Silence fails. An unmatched `[exit 1]` on a mandated needle fails.
  A later clean invocation of the *same* needle clears an earlier red.
  Do not last-wins across different needles.
- `inventory-legacy-surface` precedes `scan-with-mta`: the MTA handoff
  refuses (AR-4.1) without `evidence/entry-point-inventory.json`.
- `derive-legacy-boot3` is **not** an M1 step. The baseline is the
  frozen original source; a Boot 3 derivation is an execution-side
  transformation only.
- Path mention / grep / cat of a SKILL.md is not `skill_view`.
- Do not `kanban daemon --force`.

## Self-test

`python3 scripts/selftest.py` (golden only, never on a card): steps.json ↔ audit.json sync, order contract, fixture PASS/REFUSE set, and the paved-road coverage lint.
