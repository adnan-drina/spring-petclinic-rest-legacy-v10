"""Capture expected READ behaviour from the running SOURCE system.

Writes verification/source-oracles/<slug>.json per admitted entry point.
HTTP GET/HEAD are requested mechanically, with --path-var supplying any
templated segment from the source's own seeded data. Non-HTTP kinds need
--observation <id>=<file>.

Writes are NOT captured here. A write is a complete request against a known
initial state whose effects have to be read back, so it belongs to the
scenario corpus (capture-source-scenarios.py). Anything not captured is
recorded UNCAPTURED or INCONCLUSIVE, never invented.

Binding rule. Every oracle is bound to the FROZEN SOURCE (the evidence bundle
digest), never to the admission receipt: the source's behaviour does not
change when the destination's admission is re-sealed. Measured on v9
(2026-09-14): the sealed work-list digest differed from the one on disk 28 s
after the seal because a worker's diagnostic verify rebuilt the list -- the
normal state beside the M3 loop -- and a producer that could only run between
seals could never run beside a loop. The receipt digest is recorded on an
oracle only when the receipt is authoritative; otherwise it is "" and the
capture is still CAPTURED. --any-status is kept for callers and changes
nothing: a non-ADMITTED or stale receipt is never a refusal here.
